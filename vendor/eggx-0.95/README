               Easy and Gratifying Graphics library for X11
                       EGGX / ProCALL  version 0.95
=============================================================================

* Preface
  EGGX and ProCALL are X11 graphics libraries designed with ultimate
  simplicity.  You can enjoy 2-D graphics easily with the nostalgic BASIC-
  style functions.

  It was named PROCALL at the beginning of development (around 1999) as this
  library was compatible with API for FORTRAN called Pro-FORTRAN.  After some
  function enhancements, the functions in C no longer look like those in Pro-
  FORTRAN. We have divided this library into two libraries as shown below:

  - Functions in C: EGGX
  - Subroutines in FORTRAN: ProCALL

  The name "EGG" derives from the usage of elementary features in Xlib and
  also our hope that "egg" beginners of programming can draw a picture and
  create a game with this library.

  The APIs of EGGX allow you to create AfterStep or WindowMaker applets 
  easily.  For example, simple applets like a digital clock can be created
  by only a few dozen steps. (See plamoclock.c in examples_tutorial.)  It may
  be fun to create original applets using EGGX.

  We hope that EGGX/ProCALL can be a tool for bringing up a lot of "eggs".

* Conventions of function names
  After EGGX version 0.80, the prefix of all function (symbol) names is
  "eggx_".  If it is gopen(), the name is eggx_gopen().  By including eggx.h,
  all functions are renamed like "#define gopen eggx_gopen" by macro 
  definition, and they can be used as functions of EGGX in a straightforward
  manner.

  In a large-scale software development, however, this macro definition for
  EGGX may cause a trouble.  Specifically, a member name of a structure may
  be replaced unexpectedly by the macro definition.  To avoid such troubles,
  it is recommended that you include eggxlib.h and specify original function
  names (eggx_...) in a large-scale software development.

* Notes
  Use of the X server with over 16bpp is strongly recommended.  With 8 bpp,
  some functions do not work.
  For the X server with more than one Visual, EGGX and ProCALL open a window
  with TrueColor if TrueColor Visual is available. (It is OK if the default
  setting is PseudoColor.)
