               Easy and Gratifying Graphics library for X11
                       EGGX / ProCALL  version 0.95
=============================================================================

* How to install the program:
  - Modifying a suitable Makefile
    Choose a suitable Makefile that supports your operating system.
    By default, Makefile for Linux supporting most versions of 32-bit PC UNIX
    OS is set.
    Create a symbolic link as necessary as shown below:

      % ln -sf Makefile.linux Makefile   (Linux, MacOSX, *BSD, Cygwin, etc.)
      % ln -sf Makefile.linux64 Makefile (64-bit Linux)
      % ln -sf Makefile.sun Makefile     (Solaris)
      % ln -sf Makefile.sun64 Makefile   (64-bit Solaris)
      % ln -sf Makefile.sgi Makefile     (sgi[o32,n32,64])
      % ln -sf Makefile.hp Makefile      (HP-UX)
      % ln -sf Makefile.hp64 Makefile    (64-bit HP-UX)
      % ln -sf Makefile.old Makefile     (for old OS)

    When an error by the ps command occurs on NetBSD or MacOSX, use
    Makefile.netbsd as shown below:

      % ln -sf Makefile.netbsd Makefile  (NetBSD,MacOSX)

    If Xinerama is running, uncomment the lines shown below in Makefile:

      #LLINKS = -leggx -lX11 -lXinerama -lm
      #XDEFS = -DUSE_XINERAMA

    The maximum window size opened by EGGX and ProCALL wil be set to the
    minimum display size.

    Modify IINC and LLIB in Makefile according to your system.

    Modify CC, USERCC, and USERFC in Makefile if necessary.  The compilers
    for building EGGX/ProCALL and for user's programs can be specified
    separately.  The library and header files of EGGX are installed to
    /usr/local/lib/ and /usr/local/include/, respectively, by default.
    These paths can be changed by modifying PREFIX, INCDIR, LIBDIR, and
    BINDIR.  It is enough to modify PREFIX only in most cases.

    If you do not have a root authority, files cannot be written under
    /usr/local.  In this case, it is recommended to store all scripts for
    compile, library and header files to a directory under the user's home
    directory.  In this way, scripts for compile set the paths for include
    and header files automatically.  Modifying PREFIX, etc. in Makefile is
    not necessary.

* Make to compile 
  To compile the library, type the following command:
    % make

* Copy egg, eggx*.h, and libeggx.a
  (Example 1: with a root authority)
  If you have a root authority, switch to root with the su command and type
  "make install".
    % su
    # make install

  (Example 2: without a root authority)
  If you do not have a root authority, copy egg, eggx*.h, and libeggx.a to a
  directory.  An example of storing those files to ~/EGGX is shown below:
    % mkdir ~/EGGX
    % cp libeggx.a eggx*.h egg ~/EGGX/.
    Note: The egg command is used to compile programs. In this case, add
          "~/EGGX" to PATH or execute it with the absolute path.

  This is the end of the installation.  The compile-command egg is the shell
  script and it can be modified with an editor after installation.

  (For packagers)
  To make a binary package easily, run the make command with some options:
    $ make PREFIX=/usr
    $ make install PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR=`pwd`/pkg_dir

* Operating test
  To check the operation, type the following commands:
    % cd examples_tutorial
    % make clock
    % ./clock &

  If a simple digital clock is displayed, the build of EGGX is successfully
  done.

* Support tools for EGGX
  There are support tools for EGGX in the tools directory.
  Only "make" is required to compile them.

  - ppmtoh.c
    This tool makes the value and the array for arguments of the function
    gputimage() from the ppm file and prints them to stdout.  To check the 
    output, type the following commands:
      $ ./ppmtoh plamo_banner.ppm | less

  - xpmtoh.c
    This tool makes the value and the array for arguments of the function
    gputimage() from the xpm file and prints them to stdout.  This tool
    supports background-penetration-processing.  To check the output, type
    the following commands:
      $ ./xpmtoh plamo_banner.xpm | less
    This tool requires netpbm.
