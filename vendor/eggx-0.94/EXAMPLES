* Sample programs in the examples_game directory
  Games offered by Professor Namio Matsuda of Tokyo Denki University are
  included in this directory.
  To compile them, only "make" is needed.

  - landing
    This is a moon-landing simulation game.
    The space ship is accelerated by pressing the space key.  When the
    velocity of the landing falls below 15, the crew can land safely on the
    moon.

  - 9 puzzle
    This is a nostalgic nine puzzle game.

  - balance
    Drag the cat's hand with a mouse and try not to drop the ball.


* Sample programs in the examples_academic directory
  Academic programs are included in this directory.
  To compile them, only "make" is needed.

  - simulations directory
    This directory includes a set of simulation codes in physics.
    Professor Namio Matsuda of Tokyo Denki University offered these programs.
    Users can change parameters and various switches using the cool GUI and
    can visualize the result promptly.  This is very suitable for education.
    See README.simulation offered by Prof. Matsuda regarding the content.
    Usage of GUI is described in README.

  - galaxies.c
    This is a basic simulation program of interactions between the galaxies
    with test particles.  The results are displayed in real time while
    computation is in progress.
    The Runge-Kutta-Gill method is used for computation.

  - mandel.c
    This displays the famous Mandelbrot set.

  - raynolds_color.c
    This simulates the flock by algorithm described in Reynolds's paper.
    Instructor Yutaka Yasuda of Kyoto Sangyo University offered this program.

  - roche.c
    This visualizes the roche potential in a close binary system using colors
    and the norm and direction of power around the system using vectors.  The
    ratio of mass f can be changed by pressing PageUp or Ctrl-B and PageDown
    or Ctrl-F.  The color pattern and range can be changed by pressing 'c'
    and with cursor keys, respectively.  The image can be saved by pressing
    's'.  Press Esc or 'q' to quit this program.


* Sample programs in the examples_tutorial directory
  Tutorial programs are included in this directory.
  To compile them, only "make" is needed.

  [C language]
  - clock.c
    A simple digital clock is displayed.

  - inkey.c
    This program tests input from the keyboard.

  - loupe.c
    This is an example of how to implement the loupe function. Give any png
    file to the argument upon execution. (It's better to try with ginga.png.)
    Magnifications can be changed by clicking the mouse and the cursor can be
    changed with the space key.

  - mousetest.c
    This program tests input from the mouse and keyboard.
    In operation, you can click anywhere inside the blue window or type any
    letter from the keyboard.

  - mousetest2.c
    This is a primitive "drawing by mouse" tool.
    Bombs are drawn by default setting. After left- clicking the mouse, dots
    are drawn.
    This code can be used for handling motion events of the mouse.

  - mousetest3.c
    This program works in the non-blocking mode.
    This program has been added since version 0.85.
    This code can be used for checking input from the mouse or keyboard with
    animation.

  - plamoclock.c
    This is a digital clock with an image.
    This can be a dock application for AfterStep or WindowMaker.

  - putimg24.c
    This program transfers the banners of PlamoLinux in block from the ppm
    file and displays them.  This is for 24bpp or 16bpp only.
    Press Ctrl-c to quit this program.

  - rotate.c
    This program rotates an ellipse, a rectangle, and a star figure.
    This is offered by Instructor Yutaka Yasuda of Kyoto Sangyo University
    and modified partly.

  - sep_colorbars.c
    This program displays color bars (with a color subtraction feature).

  [FORTRAN language]
  - FORTRAN/colorbar.f
    This program draws various color bars using the color-creating subroutine
    added since version 0.71.  This is practically for 24bpp or 16bpp only.
    Press any key to quit this program.

  - FORTRAN/mouse.f
    This program tests input from the mouse and keyboard.
    In operation, you can click somewhere inside the blue window or type any
    letter from the keyboard.

  - FORTRAN/fontset.f
    This program tests drawing in Japanese language.
    This does not work if the character set of the platform is ja_JP.UTF-8.

* Sample programs in the examples.{euc, utf-8} directory
  Sample programs for the EUC or UTF-8 character set are included in this
  directory.  Choose the proper directory according to a user's environment.
  To compile them, only "make" is needed.

  - nihongo.c
    This program displays Japanese characters using the most basic Japanese
    font.  If it is not displayed, users need to install fonts.

  - 2ch.c
    This program is only used to draw "Monar" and "Gikoneko."
    To display it properly, the Monar font is needed.  Some characters may be
    turned into garbage in the environment with the UTF-8 character set.

  - rupin.c
    This program draws the cartoon character Lupin the Third.
    The font "-kochi-gothic-medium-r-normal--..." is needed to display it
    properly.  When the system gets a font via xfs (for example by default
    setting in Redhat), it cannot display the character smoothly.
